# PayGate

This application was generated using JHipster 7.1.0, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v7.1.0](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v7.1.0).

## IDE Setup

Run these commands to install all required extensions for vs-code

```
code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode
code --install-extension redhat.java
code --install-extension redhat.vscode-commons
code --install-extension redhat.vscode-xml
code --install-extension SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode
code --install-extension streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
code --install-extension VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode
code --install-extension vscjava.vscode-java-debug
code --install-extension vscjava.vscode-java-dependency
code --install-extension vscjava.vscode-java-pack
code --install-extension vscjava.vscode-java-test
code --install-extension vscjava.vscode-maven
```

After installing extensions, Go to VS code settings (`Ctrl + Comma` in most cases, otherwise `Files -> Preferences -> Settings`) and click on the text highlighted on this image.<br/>
![image](/uploads/19672b1b14d5cbbaa34f1171e89fe0ad/image.png)

Add this code to the end of the opened settings configuration file.

```json
"sonarlint.rules": {
    "typescript:S3358": {
        "level": "off"
    }
},
```

like this<br/>
![image](/uploads/7b1b618b415318dfa402bb26246acc0c/image.png)

If everything is perfectly running you should see VS code window like this<br/>
![image](/uploads/741034e52010e7a566e3088875f1c8bf/image.png)

If there are some warnings shown around those icons, please click on them and vs code fill guide you through steps to resolve them. For example, see this<br/>

### Note

If you see the spell checker showing any warnings in any file you are working on, either add it to project's whitelist (dictionary) or correct it. It doesn't matter whether the change was made by you or someone else in the past, commit would fail for your changes unless you correct it. To add a word to dictionary, add it to `"words"` list in `.cspell.json` file.

If you want to ignore a whole file, either add the file to ignored path in `.cspell.json` or add a comment in the file as specified here: https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell/blob/main/packages/cspell/README.md#in-document-settings

In case you have to make a hotfix and wants to force commit the file bypassing the validations, add `--no-verify` to git commit command. Example

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message + A valid reason why this should bypass pre-commit hooks"
```

When you commit this way, make sure you specify the reason for disabling the verification, on the commit message as shown above. This would give an answer to some one in the future when wondering _how did this `un-acceptable` change came here?_.

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./gradlew -x webapp
npm start
```

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

The service worker initialization code is commented out by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `src/main/webapp/index.html`:

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js').then(function () {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
  }
</script>
```

Note: [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) powers JHipster's service worker. It dynamically generates the `service-worker.js` file.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

```
npm install --save --save-exact leaflet
```

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet
```

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the PayGate application for production, run:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar build/libs/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./gradlew -Pprod -Pwar clean bootWar
```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport
```

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

```
npm test
```

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off authentication in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the gradle plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jibDockerBuild
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
